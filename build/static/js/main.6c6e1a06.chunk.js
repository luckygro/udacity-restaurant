Yes, it still has all the hits \u2014 the kung pao pastrami, the thrice cooked bacon \u2014but chef/proprietor Danny Bowien and executive chef Angela Dimayuga have also added a raw bar, two generous family-style set menus, and showstoppers like duck baked in clay.

Must orders: GREEN TEA NOODS, sounds gross (to me at least) but these were incredible!, Kung pao pastrami (but you already knew that), beef tartare was a fun appetizer that we decided to try, the spicy ma po tofu SUPER spicy but delicous, egg rolls and scallion pancake i could have passed on...

Having read much, I knew going into it that it was not going to be authentic Chinese. The place was edgy, had a punk rock throwback attitude, and generally delivered the desired atmosphere. Things went downhill from there though. The food was okay at best and the best qualities were easily overshadowed by what I believe to be poor decisions by the kitchen staff."}]},{"id":2,"name":"Emily","neighborhood":"Brooklyn","photograph":"2.jpg","address":"919 Fulton St, Brooklyn, NY 11238","latlng":{"lat":40.683555,"lng":-73.966393},"cuisine_type":"Pizza","operating_hours":{"Monday":"5:30 pm - 11:00 pm","Tuesday":"5:30 pm - 11:00 pm","Wednesday":"5:30 pm - 11:00 pm","Thursday":"5:30 pm - 11:00 pm","Friday":"5:30 pm - 11:00 pm","Saturday":"5:00 pm - 11:30 pm","Sunday":"12:00 pm - 3:00 pm, 5:00 pm - 11:00 pm"},"reviews":[{"name":"Steph","date":"October 26, 2016","rating":4,"comments":"Five star food, two star atmosphere.

Too juicy for its own good and downright addicting. Also try the Colony pizza. Many others looked like worth competitors, but the Colony really found its way to my heart. when you start with a great crust, top it with top notch cheese and sauce, you\'ve got a winner. But, if you go a step further and add the salty from the pepperoni, the sweet from the honey, and the spicy from the chili oil.... your mouth is confused and happy at the same time."}]},{"id":3,"name":"Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong","neighborhood":"Manhattan","photograph":"3.jpg","address":"1 E 32nd St, New York, NY 10016","latlng":{"lat":40.747143,"lng":-73.985414},"cuisine_type":"Asian","operating_hours":{"Monday":"11:30 am - 2:00 am","Tuesday":"11:30 am - 2:00 am","Wednesday":"11:30 am - 2:00 am","Thursday":"11:30 am - 2:00 am","Friday":"11:30 am - 6:00 am","Saturday":"11:30 am - 6:00 am","Sunday":"11:30 am - 2:00 am"},"reviews":[{"name":"Steve","date":"October 26, 2016","rating":4,"comments":"The tables at this 32nd Street favorite are outfitted with grills for cooking short ribs, brisket, beef tongue, rib eye, and pork jowl.

The potato salad was very light and tasted clean ( less mayo, lots of dill and some cucumber) -- refreshing for a humid summer night! Sandwich was surprisingly delicious - it is very small ( funny allusion to a White Castle burger) but it packs a punch! Not only are there layers of flavors ( amazing sauces) but the party itself had a great texture Ahmed flavor-- well done and so wonderful!
